This project is a sleek, modern web application leveraging the power of Vite for a blazing fast development setup and Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling. It incorporates several powerful libraries and technologies to enhance its functionality and user experience. The core features include the use of Radix UI for accessible UI components, date-fns for handling dates, and Sonner for elegant notifications. A significant highlight is the integration of the SpeechRecognition API, which transforms user audio into notes, demonstrating an innovative approach to input methods. Additionally, this project employs the concept of Lifting State Up for efficient management of notes and ensures data persistence using LocalStorage.
